Google Input Tool on Desktop
============================

This project provides desktop wrappers for [Google's online input tool](https://google.com/inputtools/try), which I personaly assume belong to the same parent project of [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin). Network requests to Google's servers are made on the fly during typing, therefore the core features are provided by proprietary technologies and data privacy are not protected.

Currently only the [iBus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus) frontend is available. Contributions to other frontends are welcomed!
